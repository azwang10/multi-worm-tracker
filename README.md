# multi-worm-tracker

Returns worm tracks from 3 fps monocolor behavioral recordings in `.avi` format and requires up to 50GB of free storage for a 2 h recording that will be deleted at the end of anaylsis.

See the `multiwormtracker.ipynb` for more details on implementation.

`python_multi-worm-tracker_pitch_102323.pdf` also contains more information on what this code is based on and a comparision to the exiting MATLAB tracker. **Note:** speed is off by a factor of 9 in the speed plot.
